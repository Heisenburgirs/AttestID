AttestID: Advanced Identity Verification for Decentralized Networks

AttestID harnesses the power of NFTs to provide a multi-tiered verification system for external digital wallets. This system offers a scalable method to authenticate genuine users in decentralized ecosystems:

Dynamic Verification Levels: AttestID introduces a tiered verification system. Holding an NFT issued by WorldID signifies a basic on-chain attestation of a user's uniqueness (Level 1). As users link additional platforms like Twitter to their NFT, the verification level escalates, incrementing with each additional linked platform.

Comprehensive NFT Metadata: Each NFT has the potential to contain metadata detailing the user's linked social media handles and names. Additionally, it embeds on-chain attestations & verification hashes, and timestamps. This comprehensive data serves as a transparent record of the user's verification status.

Customizable Security Thresholds: Projects can set their specific criteria for user authentication. For instance, a DAO might require users to possess a Level 2 verification NFT for participation. By prompting users to sign a message, projects can easily cross-verify the ownership of the wallet and inspect the NFT's metadata to ensure compliance.

Community Gating: With the rise of decentralized communities on platforms like Discord and Telegram, ensuring a genuine user base is crucial. AttestID can be integrated with tools like Collab.land to gate community access. When users connect their wallets, the system checks for the requisite verification NFT, ensuring only authentic users gain access.

Bot Mitigation: By setting a minimum verification level, projects, DAOs, and DApps can significantly reduce the infiltration of bots, creating a more genuine and secure user environment.

In essence, AttestID offers a robust framework to validate user uniqueness, empowering decentralized entities to maintain genuine user bases with confidence.
